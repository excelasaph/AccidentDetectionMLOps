# MongoDB Integration for Training & Prediction Data

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your AccidentDetectionMLOps project now has **complete MongoDB integration** for both training data uploads AND prediction image storage, creating a comprehensive MLOps data pipeline.

## âœ… What's Implemented

### 1. **Training Data Upload with MongoDB Storage**
- When users upload training data through Streamlit â†’ **it gets stored in MongoDB GridFS**
- Files are saved both to disk AND MongoDB for redundancy
- Each uploaded image is stored with metadata (label, sequence info, etc.)

### 2. **Prediction Image Storage** ðŸ†•
- **Every prediction** now stores images in MongoDB GridFS
- Prediction metadata tracked (result, confidence, timestamp)
- Complete audit trail of all predictions made
- Images can be converted to training data later

### 3. **Enhanced Retraining Process**
- The `/retrain` endpoint uses **BOTH** file-based data AND uploaded MongoDB data
- Uses the new `load_sequence_data_with_mongodb()` function
- Automatically combines data from multiple sources for comprehensive training

### 4. **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard** ðŸ†•
- **New "Prediction Analytics" page** in Streamlit
- Real-time prediction statistics and history
- Ability to convert predictions to training data
- Training data sources dashboard shows all available data

## ðŸ”„ Complete Data Flow

```
TRAINING DATA FLOW:
1. User uploads training images â†’ Stored in MongoDB GridFS
2. Retraining combines file + MongoDB data â†’ Enhanced model

PREDICTION DATA FLOW:
1. User uploads prediction images â†’ Prediction made
2. Images + metadata stored in MongoDB GridFS
3. Available in Analytics dashboard
4. Can be converted to training data â†’ Improved model

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT LOOP:
Predictions â†’ Analytics â†’ Training Data â†’ Better Model â†’ Better Predictions
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**MongoDB Connection:** âœ… Working  
**GridFS Storage:** âœ… Active (training + prediction images)  
**Training Data Integration:** âœ… Complete  
**Prediction Data Storage:** âœ… Complete  
**Analytics Dashboard:** âœ… Complete  
**Data Conversion Pipeline:** âœ… Complete  

## ðŸš€ Enhanced User Experience

### Training Data Management:
- âœ… Upload new training data directly through UI
- âœ… Data automatically used in retraining
- âœ… Dashboard shows all available data sources
- âœ… Seamless integration between file-based and uploaded data

### Prediction Analytics: ðŸ†•
- âœ… Every prediction stored and tracked
- âœ… Comprehensive prediction history
- âœ… Real-time statistics (accuracy rates, confidence levels)
- âœ… Convert interesting predictions to training data
- âœ… Complete audit trail for model decisions

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Complete Integration

Run the test scripts to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Test training data integration
python test_mongodb_integration.py

# Test prediction data integration  
python test_prediction_mongodb.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ New Components Added

### 1. **Enhanced Database Methods:**
- `store_prediction_record()` - Store prediction metadata
- `get_prediction_history()` - Retrieve prediction history
- `get_prediction_stats()` - Calculate prediction statistics

### 2. **New FastAPI Endpoints:**
- `/predict` - Enhanced to store images in MongoDB
- `/prediction-history` - Get recent predictions
- `/prediction-stats` - Get prediction analytics
- `/add-prediction-to-training` - Convert predictions to training data

### 3. **New Streamlit Pages:**
- **"Prediction Analytics"** - Complete prediction dashboard
- Enhanced prediction results with MongoDB storage status
- Real-time navigation to analytics from prediction results

### 4. **Data Conversion Pipeline:**
- Convert prediction images to training data
- Specify correct labels for mislabeled predictions
- Continuous model improvement workflow

## ðŸŽ‰ Complete MLOps Data Pipeline

**Your system now provides:**

### ðŸ“ˆ **Data Collection:**
